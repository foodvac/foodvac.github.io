<title>Patrick's Bio</title>
<body>
<p>Patrick was born on Pluto in the year 8232 AC. After inventing a time machine in the year 8301, Patrick time traveled to the year 2011, and found Pluto to be very cold and uninhabited. He then searched for human settlements and realized that the human race was still very primitive and still only lived on Earth.</p>
<p>After a year of traveling through space, he arrived on Earth and settled down. He went through a year or two of high school (who knows?), then attended Tufts University.</p>
